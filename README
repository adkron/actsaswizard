ActsAsWizard
============
Build dynamic wizards on the web with very little code.  Sticking to
convention over configuration, I think that this plugin will be useful
and familiar to seasoned Rails developers, but easy enough for the new
Rails developers, too.

I hope the example makes the code self explanatory.

I would also love for someone to come along and help me write tests for
this.  Not using TDD goes totally against my normal coding style.  This
started as a spike, and morphed its way into code I didn't want to throw
away.  Now I've gotten so excited over it that I just want to get it out
there for feedback.

Requirements
============
This plugin requires Scott Barron's acts_as_state_machine plugin.  It
can be installed with the following command.

>script/plugin install http://elitists.textdriven.com/svn/plugins/acts_as_state_machine/trunk

Example
=======
# app/models/employee.rb
# The symbols passed to acts_as_wizard must correspond
# to the models that are the pages, and are in desired
# display order
class Employee < ActiveRecord::Base
	acts_as_wizard :personal_information, :work_information
end



# app/models/personal_informtion.rb
# acts_as_wizard_page is really an alias for belongs_to
# but it makes the functionality clear
class PersonalInformation < ActiveRecord::Base
	acts_as_wizard_page :employee
end



# app/controllers/employees_controller.rb
# the controller has a few notable functions that need to be called
# also notice the page instance variable.  That is important
# for the view helper methods
class EmployeesController < ApplicationController
	acts_as_wizard_controller
		
	def edit 
		@employee = Employee.find(params[:id])
		@page = get_wizard_page @employee
	end
	
	def update 
		@employee = Employee.find(params[:id])
		@page = update_current_wizard_page @employee
		@employee.save
		redirect_to :action => :edit
	end
end



# app/views/employees/edit.html.erb
# notice the wizard partial render and the previous and next button functions
<%=javascript_include_tag :defaults %>
<% form_for(@employee) do |f| -%> 
	<fieldset> 
		<%= render_wizard_partial @employee %> 
	</fieldset>  
	<hr/> 
		<table class="controls"> 
			<tr> 
				<td>
					<%= previous_wizard_button @employee %>
				</td> 
				<td> 
					<%= next_wizard_button %> 
				</td> 
			</tr> 
		</table> 
<% end -%>



# app/views/employee_wizard_pages/_personal_information.html.erb
# notice the name of the folder corresponds to the wizard model name
# and the template file corresponds to the name of the page model
# notice the text_field tag is a little different
<h1>Personal Information</h1>
<label for="personal_information_name">Name</label>
<%= wizard_page_text_field page, :name %>



# The wizard model doesn't have to hold any information because the pages belong to it
class CreateEmployees < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :employees do |t|
      t.string :state

      t.timestamps
    end
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :employees
  end
end



# Migration for a wizard page holds all the information for the wizard
class CreatePersonalInformations < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :personal_informations do |t|
      t.integer :agency_id
      t.string :name

      t.timestamps
    end
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :personal_informations
  end
end



Thank You

be better way to make a wizard, and for trying Rails even when he had
never written Ruby.
